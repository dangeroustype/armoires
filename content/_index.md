description: NYC French Book Club welcomes you! With this group, the goal is to meet others who share an affinity for French literature. We will be reading everything from the classics to more contemporary novels that haven't been translated yet. As there are not many French bookstores in the city, we'll be choosing books that we can buy or borrow easily.
